These exit window scores overrule any other score related to the two-way peg. For example: If a rollup-style layer leverages tBTC (a yellow or red score) to natively mint bitcoin-backed tokens, but has an immediately upgradeable contract, then the layer will receive a ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù score in the assessment.</li>
                <li>Due to complexities related to federated set ups, we will additionally highlight more granular trust assumptions for federated two-way pegs in a subsection of the review. In this upcoming framework, we will outline how a federated peg can be upgraded to yellow if it meets a certain threshold of requirements.</li>
                <li>Additional situations can be added to this framework for edge cases. For example, users of Statechains can unilaterally exit with a Bitcoin L1 transaction, but an operator can steal funds by colluding with the past owner, and users cannot submit a challenge transaction.</li>

    <p>This framework can be easier to customize and provide more nuance given the number of scaling solutions that are present in Bitcoin today. For example, related to block production/network operators, we can add even more scoring mechanisms based on how decentralized the network is. E.g. A network with 200 validators is better than a network with 10, and we can customize the assessment to highlight this.</p>
    <br />
    <p>This risk assessment is an initial starting point to analyze Bitcoin scaling protocols. It is a living document and is subject to change.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Bitcoin does not have a unified scaling roadmap. There are tradeoffs with every protocol being implemented to support Bitcoin scaling. This framework hopes to capture some of the nuance related to the various designs being proposed.</p>
