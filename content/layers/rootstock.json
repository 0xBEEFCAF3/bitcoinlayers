The network is not secured by another token. As an EVM-compatible network, developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts with arbitrary logic, creating a host of new applications for Bitcoin the asset. Rootstock has an enshrined cross-chain BTC asset called ''Smart Bitcoin'' (RBTC), which is pegged 1:1 to BTC and secured by a permissioned, 12-seat multi-sig federation."

          "content": "The bridge between bitcoin and Rootstock is secured by a 5-of-9 federated multisig, referred to as the Powpeg (Proof of Work Peg). The Powpeg is operated by special nodes referred to as Powpeg functionaries. The Powpeg functionaries are: BlockVenture, Collider, Constata, Luxor, MyCointainer, pNetwork, Rootstock Labs, Sovryn, and Xapo.\n\nEach functionary operates a Powpeg node. A Powpeg node combines a specialized Rootstock full node with a Proof of Work Hardware Security Module (PowHSM). A PowHSM is a hardware device designed to remove human control over the bitcoin private keys used to sign Powpeg multisig transactions. PowHSM operators cannot manually sign transactions, extract private keys, or perform any other functions with the private keys. The PowHSM firmware is open source and available in the Rootstock GitHub repo.\n\nRequests by users to withdraw BTC from the Powpeg bridge must be approved by a majority of Powpeg functionaries. If a functionary's PowHSM is online, then it will automatically sign a withdrawal transaction after the withdrawal request reaches a sufficient number of confirmations on the Rootstock blockchain.\n\nBTC held in the Powpeg bridge can be stolen if a majority of PowHSM devices are compromised.\n\nAdditionally, the Powpeg uses a time-locked emergency 3-of-4 federated multisig as a safeguard against PowHSM device failures or possible external intervention. The emergency multisig signers are: Rootstock Labs, MoneyOnChain, Jameson Lopp, and Adrian Eidelman. In the event of an emergency, these signatories will evaluate the situation and coordinate for the recovery of funds.\n\nBTC held in the emergency multisig can be lost or stolen if a majority of the emergency multisig signers are compromised.\n\nIf BTC held in the Powpeg bridge (or emergency multisig, if the emergency multisig procedure has been activated) is lost or stolen, then users will not be able to convert RBTC to BTC and exit the bridge.\n\nTo potentially improve the trust assumptions of the Rootstock bitcoin bridge, Rootstock Labs is funding research into BitVMX, a protocol that can be used to develop a trust-minimized 1-of-N federated bitcoin bridge."

RSK claims to have three phases for merge-mining growth, a bootstrap phase (<30% of BTC hashrate), stable phase (60% ≥ RSK ≥ 30%), and its mature phase (≥60%). Currently, Rootstock is in its stable phase. In order to pay out miners, every block executes the Reward Manager Smart Contract (REMASC). The contract keeps record of the Reward Balance account, which exists to change value during new block production. When a block reaches maturity, the appropriate portions of rewards are distributed according to REMASC specified rules. The Full Block Reward is paid out in the following breakdown: 20% to RSK, .8% to RSK Federation, 79.2% to miners. Miners only receive rewards from transaction fees, as there is no issuance since the network native currency is RBTC. Fees dedicated to the federation and miners serve to incentivize the continued security, whereas the 20% dedicated to RSK/RSK Labs is dedicated to the future maintenance and development of the network."

Essentially, BTC mining pools add references to RSK blocks in mining jobs sent to mining participants. Additionally, because the Rootstock mining algorithm is similar to Bitcoin’s, there is little added energy expenditure. This combined with miners earning a portion of transaction fees from RSK block mining creates an incentive for both providing security to BTC and to Rootstock."

Solidity is the primary coding language used for smart contract development on the EVM. Solidity and the EVM are the dominant language and environment for smart contracts in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, respectively. Smart contracts created for the EVM are directly compatible with the RVM. The RVM is EVM-compatible at both the bytecode and opcode level, and can interact with Ethereum developer tooling. The RVM uses RBTC as its gas cost for smart contract execution."
