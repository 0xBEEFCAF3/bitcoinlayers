The network is not secured by another token. As an EVM-compatible network, developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts with arbitrary logic, creating a host of new applications for Bitcoin the asset. Rootstock has an enshrined cross-chain BTC asset called Smart Bitcoin (RBTC), which is pegged 1:1 to BTC and secured by a permissioned, 12-seat multi-sig federation.."
