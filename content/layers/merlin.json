    "description": "Merlin is an implementation of Polygon CDK chain. It looks to build a validia chain using an alternative system for data availability. It will be leveraging the Bsquared Network parent blockchain for settlement. Its documentation shares that it will add Bitcoin native security in the future, but no code or research has been released.",
