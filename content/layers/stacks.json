However, it is still expressive enough to build complex smart contracts and replicate much of the functionalities from Turing-complete environments like the EVM (i.e., DeFi, NFTs, etc.). Stacks is able to read Bitcoin state, due to both Clarity and its integrated PoX consensus mechanism. This allows for events on Stacks to be triggered by Bitcoin activity, or for smart contracts to read Bitcoin state during their execution."

The winning miner creates the block, and is rewarded with the STX block reward and STX transaction fees from the block. The miner's bid is paid to STX stackers (stakers). This system allows for STX stackers to earn native BTC yield, and creates an additional revenue stream for miners, similar to merge-mining."
