These validators supposedly stake BitLayer's native token, BTR, to secure the network. The Bitcoin on BitLayer is wBTC, which is a Bitcoin synthetic that is managed by a centralized operator. The bridge contract, which custodies wBTC on BitLayer, is upgradeable and is ultimately operated by a centralized admin. In its current state, BitLayer has a number of centralized points of failure. Users should be cautious when interacting with BitLayer."
