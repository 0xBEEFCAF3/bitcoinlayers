It supports an EVM execution environment with plans to support other VMs. In its docs, BitLayer states that it will use an offchain data availability solution in its future mainnet releases. Its roadmap sees it adding support for a BitVM-style bridge, but currently, the bridge is managed by various multi-sig wallets.",
