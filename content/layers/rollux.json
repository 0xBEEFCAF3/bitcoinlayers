    "description": "Rollux is an optimistic rollup that settles on Syscoin, a Layer 1 blockchain that is merge-mined by Bitcoin miners who opt-in to additionally becoming Syscoin miners. Rollux's native token is SYS, and users can access synthetic forms of BTC via a bridge between Rollux and Syscoin's EVM chain (and other EVM chains). We are reviewing the security assumptions related to Rollux and its Bitcoin bridges.",
