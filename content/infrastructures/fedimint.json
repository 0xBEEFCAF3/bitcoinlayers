          "content": "Fedimints are a module based system for building federated applications. They are currently focused on building federated ecash mints, which would offer improved privacy for peer-to-peer payments. The construction of a Fedimint sees users lock their BTC into a Federation's multi-sig, and receive an Ecash IOU representing the BTC in the Federation. Fedimints are also useful for community custody, an idea that sees users trust members of their local community (e.g., family members) with the custody of their Bitcoin assets."

After transactions are submitted by clients, proposals are sent to consensus particpants who agree on the validity of the proposal. These Federations can have varying level of signers dependent on the federation, but all Federations will rely on an honest majority assumption of signers."

While this doesn't see users inherit any security directly, because they are still trusting members of a federation, it does ensure that the node operators inherit security from the Bitcoin network. This is useful because Bitcoin's consistent uptime ensures that the Fedimint node operators would also inherit Bitcoin's liveness, which is helpful for users."
